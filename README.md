This project is meant to give The Odin Project students a chance to showcase the new information
and content taught over the past few lessons. This time itâ€™s a sign-up form for an imaginary service. I have provided the sample given by The Odin Project. This gives students a general
idea of how they are meant to structure their HTML and how the end product should look like.
The example provided is only a general path that students can follow. It is not meant for students
to make an exact copy of the example. Students are given freedom to choose how their form will 
look like.
